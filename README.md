# tlearn

Fast R/C++ toolkit for transfer learning with least squares.

**Under the hood:**
<ul>
  <li>R/RcppArmadillo for fast linear Algebra calculations in C++</li>
  <li>Parallelization with OpenMP</li>
  <li>Extensively microbenchmarking to achieve fastest possible implementation</li>
  <li>Dedicated double (precise) and float (fast) implementations</li>
  <li>Dedicated dense and sparse implementations</li>
  <li>First-in-class multinomial and binary least squares constraints</li>
  <li>First-in-class L0 truncation on sample and model coefficients</li>  
  <li>Convenient R front-end for every single C++ solver. Broadly applicable beyond transfer learning.</li>
</ul>
